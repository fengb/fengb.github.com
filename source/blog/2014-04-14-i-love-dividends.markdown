title: I Love Dividends
---
I am a huge fan of dividend paying stocks.  While not the most efficient return
in shareholder value, dividends provides some qualities that are better than
its counterpart share repurchases.

## Drawbacks

There are many investors that avoid and criticize dividends.  I can fully
understand and even agree with their stances:

* **Dividends are taxable.**  Unless hidden inside a retirement account, a
  payout triggers a mandatory taxation event: anywhere from 0%-39.6% under
  2014 tax brackets.

* **Dividends do nothing.** When a dividend is paid out, the price
  [drops by the payout amount](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend#Effect_on_stock_price).
  Because of this effect, a dividend ultimately does not add any direct value.

Due to both of these effects, it is arguable that dividends are actually a net
negative: forcing a taxation event on the change in price.

## Benefits

Despite major technical downsides, dividends has many advantages that are not
easily captured on paper:

* **Dividends are resilient to financial engineering.**  Dividends are dependent
  on cashflows, which have much stricter reporting rules compared with earnings
  reports and balance sheets.  In addition, a paid dividend is gone and cannot
  be recalled.  Management would oppose paying a dividend if they were cooking
  the books.

* **Dividends indicates management maturity.**  A small company generally has
  more ideas than money, but as it matures, cashflows will eventually grow
  faster than good ideas.  When this happens, companies are faced with three
  options: spend money at not-very-good ideas, hoard the cash, or return it to
  the shareholders.  Recognizing the limitations of spending or hoarding money
  is a sign of a mature management team.

* **Dividends show long term confidence.**  While dividends are not guaranteed,
  management does not like to cut payouts due to its strong signal of future
  weakness.  Therefore, a dividend is generally initiated when management feels
  confident for the long term.

These intangible qualities show trustworthiness in the management team.
