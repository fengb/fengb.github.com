title: I Dislike Splits... Usually
---
Stock splits have been recently in the limelight due in no small part to the
high profile Google and Apple.  I am usually against splits for a big reason:
it's distracting noise.  As the wise Yogi Berra once said, "You better cut the
pizza in four pieces because I'm not hungry enough to eat six."  There is a lot
of fuss over mostly pointless actions.

## Drawbacks

In the long run, a split does absolutely nothing for a business.  It does not
improve earnings, cashflows, branding, or any other intrinsic value measurement.
Management that executes a split are diverting attention from business
improvement to stock price engineering.

Warren Buffett argues that splits are actually a detriment: they attract
short-term traders.  These finicky "investors" are largely focused on
pump-and-dump, focusing more on price movements over key fundamentals.  At the
worst, their loud voices are yet another distraction from the business.

## Benefits

In the short term, the stock market is a voting machine.  Stocks splits are
generally followed by consistent bump in price performance; investors are likely
to believe the split is an indicator of near-term growth and thus drive up
momentum.  There are also people who believe the lower prices are actually
cheaper and increase demand volume.

## Conclusion

For Apple, this is likely one of their best financial engineering moves.  Until
this week, Apple's high stock price has prevented it from joining the Dow Jones
Industrial Average due to DJIA being [price-weighted](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-10-21/googles-1-000-stock-is-too-high-to-be-in-the-price-weighted-dow).
With their latest 7-to-1 split, Apple is now a strong candidate for inclusion
and will definitely see a price boost if it happens.

I like Apple's split only because I am in it for the short-term.
