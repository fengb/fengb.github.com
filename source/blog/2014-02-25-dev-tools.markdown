title: Dev Tools
---
This is a list of tools I use regularly.  This is a living post and will be
updated periodically.

## Hardware
**[Macbook Air 13"](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/)** &mdash;
For churning out code, I live and die at the command line, but I also like
operating in a modern desktop environment for everything else.  Windows' command
line support is largely terrible, and while Linux can come close, I would rather
not spend hours tweaking everything.  All of the Mac laptop models have their
advantages, but I ultimately chose the 13-inch Air primarily due to its battery
life and the *lack* of retina; retina is great, but it ruined all other displays
for me.

**[Monoprice 27" IPS-Glass Panel Pro](http://www.monoprice.com/Product?p_id=10489)** &mdash;
27-inch monitors are the gold standard due to the influx of
[cheap Korean panels](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/the-ips-lcd-revolution.html).
I picked Monoprice over Korea because they are local, have a perfect panel
guarantee, and contain extra input ports.  The speakers are iffy, but the
display is gorgeous.

## Command Line
**[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)** &mdash;
Unlike fink and MacPorts of yonder, brew actually solved my package management
needs.  In fact, most everything else in this section is usually installed by
brew.

**[homebrew-cask](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask)** &mdash;
A sister to Homebrew, cask is a way to deliver software binaries.

**[fengb-common](https://github.com/fengb/common)** &mdash;
I generally avoid customization, but there are certain default features that
just bug me.

**[ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)** &mdash;
ag searches files much faster than find / xargs / grep combinations.

**[z](https://github.com/rupa/z)** &mdash;
z memorizes the directories most often navigated into.  Works perfectly for me
since most of my navigation stops at the top level of a project.

**[chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) / [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install)** &mdash;
chruby uses a simple convention to manage multiple rubies, and ruby-install
can exploit that convention to seamlessly install said multiple rubies.  The
architecture is much simpler than its competitors: rvm and rbenv / ruby-build.

## Mac Only
**[Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)** &mdash;
Alfred is often touted as an "application launcher" but it is so much more.
With one hotkey, I can quickly switch to the Terminal, search Google, or even
run a quick math calculation.  As one of my colleagues said, "It's kinda like
Clippy but actually useful."

**[Asepsis](http://asepsis.binaryage.com/)** &mdash;
Hate .DS_Store files as much as me?  Install Asepsis and never hate again!

**[f.lux](http://justgetflux.com/)** &mdash;
f.lux changes your monitors at night to emit less blue light, which has been
shown in research studies to disturb sleep patterns.  Since I have installed
f.lux, I have yet to experience insomnia.

**[Spectacle](http://spectacleapp.com/)** &mdash;
Spectacle allows you to bind hotkeys for quickly resizing and moving windows
(such as expand the window to half the screen on the left side).  While it does
not offer the customizability of similar apps, it does what I need it to do
without too much hassle.
