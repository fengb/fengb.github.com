    <p>While programming, I live and die at the command line.  However, I do
       enjoy dabbling in a modern desktop environment.  OS X may not be perfect,
       but it comes pretty close out of the box.  Linux can be better, but I
       actually hate customization when I can avoid it.</p>
    <p>Choosing between a 13-inch Air and a 13-inch Pro Retina was tougher.  The
       Air is cheaper, lighter, and has a longer battery life, but the Pro Retina's
       display is unbelievably crisp.  I ultimately chose the Air because I
       realized that a Retina monitor reconditioned my eyes such that I had a
       hard time using a non-retina screen, such as most desktop monitors.</p>

    <p>27-inch monitors are the gold standard due to the influx of
       <a href='http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/the-ips-lcd-revolution.html'>cheap Korean panels</a>.
       I picked Monoprice over Korea because they are local, have a perfect
       panel guarantee, and contain extra input ports.  The speakers are iffy,
       but the display is gorgeous.</p>

    <p>My first forays into the developer world involved <a href='http://www.debian.org/'>Debian</a>,
       <a href='http://www.gentoo.org/'>Gentoo</a>, <a href='https://www.archlinux.org/'>Arch Linux</a>,
       and <a href='https://www.freebsd.org/'>FreeBSD</a>.  The one thing they
       all had in common was package management.  When I first used a Mac, I
       played around with <a href='http://www.finkproject.org/'>fink</a> and
       <a href='http://www.macports.org/'>MacPorts</a> and hated both.  So it
       was my pleasant surprise when Homebrew worked so effectively.</p>
    <p>It is a little annoying that brews are source based, but they do not take
       too long to compile.</p>

    <p>A sister to Homebrew, Cask is a way to deliver software binaries.</p>
