## Hardware
**[Macbook Air 13"](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/)** &mdash; While churning
out code, I live and die at the command line, but I also like operating in a
modern desktop environment for everything else.  Windows' command line support
is largely terrible, and while Linux can come close, I would rather not spend
hours customizing everything.  All of the laptop models have their advantages,
but I ultimately chose the 13-inch Air primarily due to its battery life and the
*lack* of retina; retina is great, but it ruined all other displays for me.

**[Monoprice 27" IPS-Glass Panel Pro](http://www.monoprice.com/Product?p_id=10489)** &mdash;
27-inch monitors are the gold standard due to the influx of
[cheap Korean panels](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/the-ips-lcd-revolution.html).
I picked Monoprice over Korea because they are local, have a perfect panel
guarantee, and contain extra input ports.  The speakers are iffy, but the
display is gorgeous.

## Command Line
**[Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)** &mdash; Unlike fink and MacPorts of yonder, brew
actually solved my package management needs.  In fact, most everything else in
this section is usually installed by brew.

**[homebrew-cask](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask)** &mdash; A sister to
Homebrew, cask is a way to deliver software binaries.
