## Hardware
### [Macbook Air 13"](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air/)
While programming, I live and die at the command line.  However, I do enjoy
dabbling in a modern desktop environment.  OS X may not be perfect, but it comes
pretty close out of the box.  Linux can be better, but I actually hate
customization when I can avoid it.

Choosing between a 13-inch Air and a 13-inch Pro Retina was tougher.  The Air is
cheaper, lighter, and has a longer battery life, but the Pro Retina's display is
unbelievably crisp.  I ultimately chose the Air because I realized that a Retina
monitor reconditioned my eyes such that I had a hard time using a non-retina
screen, such as most desktop monitors.

### [Monoprice 27" IPS-Glass Panel Pro](http://www.monoprice.com/Product?p_id=10489)
27-inch monitors are the gold standard due to the influx of
[cheap Korean panels](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/the-ips-lcd-revolution.html).
I picked Monoprice over Korea because they are local, have a perfect panel
guarantee, and contain extra input ports.  The speakers are iffy, but the
display is gorgeous.

## Command Line
### [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) &mdash; package management for OS X
My first forays into the developer world involved [Debian](http://www.debian.org/),
[Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org/), [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), and
[FreeBsd](https://www.freebsd.org/).  The one thing they all had in common was
package management.  When I first used a Mac, I played around with
[fink](http://www.finkproject.org/) and [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/) and
hated both.  So it was my pleasant surprise when Homebrew worked so effectively.

It is a little annoying that brews are source based, but they do not take too
long to compile.

### [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/phinze/homebrew-cask)
A sister to Homebrew, Cask is a way to deliver software binaries.
